# Improved Chaotic CNN for Image Classification on CIFAR-10

This project implements an improved Chaotic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The network architecture incorporates chaotic neuron dynamics, aiming to improve classification accuracy on CIFAR-10, a dataset commonly used for object recognition tasks.

## Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

## Architecture
The Chaotic-CNN architecture combines traditional CNN layers with chaotic neurons in key layers to enhance classification performance.
